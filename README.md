# meteo-alerts-skill
meteo alert skill uses http://meteoalarm.eu for alerts for  mycroft.. I have it built for linux/pi version of mycroft do not know if it works on other versions

usage  in skill setting  just copy and paste in the  region you wish to monitor for alerts..  and choose your language you wish to use..    title and caption are options. if you used different page laguages from http://meteoalarm.eu 

example if you used greek 

title     
weather warngings = Προειδοποιήσεις καιρού Ευρώπης:

caption

for greek is still Caption      (and if you wanted to use greek language lietuviu: )

but spanish page it  uses Leyenda: french uses Légende:  etc  for caption

usage is simple just say "climate alerts"  or "weather alerts" and it will read out any  current alerts

currently is  just uses simple tone alert for automatic alerting .  3 tones yellow, orange and red if you have  multiple type alerts say 2 yellow 1 orange and a red    it will play first  the  1 red alert tone, then 1 orange tone , followed by 2 yellow tones..  from the simple tones you should be able the access the risk urgency ..ie  multiple red tones  pretty well means   head for shelter quickly.
